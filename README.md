##Stella Server

By Kayla Morrison

### Description
The world's cutest* webserver. Start it up and visit http://localhost:2345/index.html in your browser for the cuteness.

*cuteness only available when using included public folder, although the server will serve any folder named "public" in the directory in which it is run. Unless you also have an html document full of cuteness, then I guess you're good to go.

##Stella Server

By Kayla Morrison

### Description
the world's cutest webserver. Start it up in the directory that contains the included public folder for the cuteness.

### Installation

in your root user file:

`gem install stellaserver`

### Usage

You can leave the included public folder where it is or move it to a different folder. You can also use the server in any directory which contains a folder named "public" (but you won't get to experience the cuteness)
